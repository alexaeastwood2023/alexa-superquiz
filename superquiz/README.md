## How to use as a Typical User
  When you first open this page you are going to see a heading that states its a Super Quiz about Elephants. You will see there is two images of elephants underneath the title. Then you will see a paragraph underneath the images it says: `Do you want to play a Super Quiz on Elephants? You can either click the button to add your own fun fact about elephants and it will appear in one of the questions in the Super Quiz! If you don't want to add one, all you got to do is click the button to play! Let's test your knownledge on Elephants!!! Enjoy!`. Then underneath that it says: `Click Here If You Want Your Fun Fact About Elephants Added` with a button next to you that is clickable and will pop of a modal with a form in it. Inside the form, there is going to be a text input that you can add your question/answers. Then underneath that you will see that its says **Possible Answers (1 right, 3 wrong)** then underneath that is 4 options of text input where you can insert you answers at.  Then after you have filled out the question and the answer spots, underneath the input it says: * Please put the correct answer as opiton 1 being 0, option 2 being 1, option 3 being 2, and option 4 being 3 * (it instructs you on how to put in the correct number of your correct answer) Then you can click on the button that says submit. Remember please fill out all the inputs that you have to fill out because if not then it will not like you submit the form. After you have entered all the answers and the question and have clicked submit there will be another modal that pops up that says: `Your Question has been added!` Underneath the is another button that will close out of it if you click/ press enter/return. Then you will go back to your home page, and there is going to be another button. This time this button says: `Click Here To Play Super Quiz` Next to it is going to the be the button that you will hit if you want to play the quiz. After you click that button a set of questions about elephants will appear. When the first question shows up there is going to be 4 different choices you can chose from. When you think you know the right answer and you click on it, if you clicked the right answer, it is going to change from a background to green with a text thats says: üëè Way To Go!üëè. If you chose the wrong answer it will change to red and say this: üëéOoppss! I'm sorry! üëé. That way the user will know if their answer was the right or wrong one. There is going to be 10 questions that I created and then there will be the 1 question they added ( if they wanted to add one that is) so once you have went through all the questions that there is at the end a message will come up stating: Whooo Hoo! You got (this many) right! I'm sorry you got (this many wrong)! There will be a link underneath that stating to play the quiz again if you would like. Once you have clicked on play again it will take you back to the home page so that you can play and add another question. Underneath play again, you have an option to click on the link and a collaspe will fall down with all the correct answers just in case you wanted to see them.

 Chelsey Spaulding helped me with my constructor function and what the difference is on using the new and this on it. Alysha Eppard helped me with my functions as well as my if else statements to where when you click the wrong answer or right answer it will tell you. I wasn't putting the right condition it there. She also helped me with my inputs on my form with the question and answers that the user will add at the beginning. Eppard is the TA here for us, so once she showed me how to some things I passed it on and tried to help all the other students here in our class. Katherine Holmes gave me the idea as to when the user clicks on the answer the background will turn either green if they were correct as well as red when they clicked the incorrect answer. Ms. Grube gave me the idea of highlighting the correct answers when you got them wrong, but instead I just put a collaspe at the end of the quiz and you can see all the correct answers to all the questions.
